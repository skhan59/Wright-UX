# Wright-UX
UX mockups for Nu School Fellowship

*MADE USING ADOBE XD*

Wright is an ed-tech company I pitched to Daniel Ahmadizadeh, the CEO of PersistIQ and member of the Y Combinator. 

Wright is the 'Right way to Learn How to Wright.' It gives students the oppurtunity to write about things THEY want to write about (current events, tech, op-eds ect.)
every week the website would give a new "Trending Topic" and users could write either in favor, or against the arugement.

Based on how well researched and backed up the arguements are, users can thumbs up/down people's writing samples and at the end of the week a winner would be 
chosen for both sides.

If you thumbs down an essay though, you have to explain why. Once an essay gets too many TD's, a moderator can email it back to the OP and allow them to rewrite it.
